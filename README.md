# SpotifyToYTMusicConverter

I recently got Youtube Premium and am fed up with Spotify Ads. It's time to switch.

What most Spotify to Youtube converters do is they find the first song that appears when you search up the name on YouTube. I want to add a feature in the middle which allows the user to check whether the videos are correct, and to allow the user to fix the choice.

Inspired by a project I saw in Hack Club's The Bay. I didn't actually see the project, I just saw the name. I had this idea for a few years originally, but finally decided to start on it since I have time over the summer.

Open Planning.excalidraw with Excalidraw in order to see my prototypes!

I'm first going to make an express/HTML version, then perhaps move over to react.
